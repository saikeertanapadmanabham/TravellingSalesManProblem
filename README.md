TRAVELLING SALESMAN PROJECT:
===========================
IMPLEMENTED TSP USING BELOW FOUR ALGORITHMS.

HOW TO RUN THIS
===============
When you run the code,
	1.It will display list of 40 cities with indexes
	2.since ending city is same as starting city, it will only ask for starting city index number.
	3.Taking the list of city with indexes as reference, user can type any city index as starting city index.
	

Explanation:
===========

In the above example, starting city is given as 4
We get the results of total prize collected,sequence of the cities visited,total distance travelled and total time of execution results by using following algorithms.

1.Random Algorithm
2.Greedy Algorithm
3.Exhaustive Algorithm
4.Reinforcement Learning Algorithm

Procedure:
----------
1. Initially from input text file we get cities,latitude & longitudes and prizes data in a list
2.By using Haversine formula, we get the distance between two latitude and longitudes
3.We generate distance array matrix to calculate distance from each index to renaining points.
3.By getting start data,end date and the total prize to collect, we implement above algorithms
